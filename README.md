Crusader Kings II calculator.

Calculator can be found at ck2calc.com

I'm creating this project to help others (and myself) learn about the intricacies of Crusader Kings II.  The purpose is to expose a user friendly calculator through a web application so that the game mechanics can be understood.  The game provides a wealth of information in its tooltips, however, mechanics such as inheritance, claims, and family relations still beg many questions.

This is a Work In Progress project.  Don't expect any of the results from the calculator to be accurate or functional yet.

Feature requests are welcome at tonymyers82@gmail.com.
